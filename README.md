# Google Homepage-Hard Project

This purpose of this project was to deconstruct and rebuild a search results webpage as accurately as possible.
The provided webpage was the [Google.com search results page](https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage/) at the time.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).


## Pre-Project Thoughts

Note: At this point I only have basic HTML, CSS, Chrome Dev Tool, and Git skills.
I will do my best!

## Post-Project Thoughts

One thing the page is definitely missing is responsive design.
I will learn that later on in the curriculum.

Skills I strengthened at project end: <br>   
-HTML <br>
-CSS <br>
-Use of Chrome Developer Tools
